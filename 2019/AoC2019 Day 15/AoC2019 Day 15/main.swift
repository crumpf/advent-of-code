// --- Day 15: Oxygen System ---

/*
 The remote control program executes the following steps in a loop forever:

 - Accept a movement command via an input instruction.
 - Send the movement command to the repair droid.
 - Wait for the repair droid to finish the movement operation.
 - Report on the status of the repair droid via an output instruction.

 Only four movement commands are understood: north (1), south (2), west (3), and east (4).

 The repair droid can reply with any of the following status codes:

 0: The repair droid hit a wall. Its position has not changed.
 1: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction.
 2: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction; its new position is the location of the oxygen system.
