    //   (1) A * a.x + B * b.x = prize.x

    // Only A and B, the number of presses, are unknown, so I just expressed a solution for B in one equation, and substitued
    // it into the other to solve for A. Then I substituted the solved A back into the B equation to solve for B. Since
    // the solution is on an integer boundary I rounded the A and B solutions and checked to make sure the equations
    // still held up before returning winning prize.
    // B = (prize.x - A * a.x) / b.x
    // A = (prize.y - (b.y * prize.x / b.x)) / (a.y - (b.y * a.x / b.x))
